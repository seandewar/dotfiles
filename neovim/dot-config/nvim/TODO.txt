- Get rid of Vim compat; I rarely use Vim anymore except when contributing :)
- Use git submodules for packages
- Replace neoformat with &formatprg
- Disable unneeded plugins/stuff when opened as a pager
- Maybe consider replacing neoformat with a lsp implementation of some sort
- Don't :TSUpdate after updating nvim-treesitter, as some modules might already
  be loaded. Instead, schedule an update for the next nvim start; we can maybe
  abuse shada global vars for this if we're feeling lazy.
- Use nvim-dap? GCC also has built-in DAP support now... (but termdebug is
  pretty good)
- Yeet netrw (and vim-vinegar)? Netrw's bugs are annoying.
