 vi:set tw=80 fo+=t:

- Disable unneeded plugins/stuff when opened as a pager
- Enable vim.snippet support, if at least for expanding snippet completions from
  lsps
- Maybe consider replacing neoformat with a lsp implementation of some sort
- Don't :TSUpdate after updating nvim-treesitter, as some modules might already
  be loaded. Instead, schedule an update for the next nvim start; we can maybe
  abuse shada global vars for this if we're feeling lazy.
- Use nvim-dap? GCC also has built-in DAP support now... (but termdebug is
  pretty good)
- Maybe change some 'list' stuff (possibly highlights) to look less like text.
  (E.g: I sometimes think trailing spaces are actual "."s, and I don't like
  using Unicode symbols...)
- Yeet netrw (and vim-vinegar)? Netrw's bugs are annoying.
