 vi:set tw=80 fo+=t:

- Don't :TSUpdate after updating nvim-treesitter, as some modules might already
  be loaded. Instead, schedule an update for the next nvim start; we can maybe
  abuse shada global vars for this if we're feeling lazy.
- Use nvim-dap? GCC also has built-in DAP support now... (but termdebug is
  pretty good)
- Make 'tabline' work better when there's not enough &columns.
- Maybe change some 'list' stuff (possibly highlights) to look less like text.
  (E.g: I sometimes think trailing spaces are actual "."s, and I don't like
  using Unicode symbols...)
- Yeet netrw (and vim-vinegar)? Netrw's bugs are annoying.
- Make :ConfDir, :DataDir work with a split modifier (maybe use :lcd over :tcd
  in that case).
- Set &cmdheight=0 when low amount of &lines when the feature triggers less
  pointless press-enter prompts. We may also want to temporarily set
  &cmdheight=1 when recording a macro, and unset &showcmd if it still causes
  :file to be truncated.
- Open quickfix automatically on :grep, .etc that automatically jump to the
  list. Make sure it doesn't trigger for stuff like vim-dispatch. Ensure it
  plays nicely with all relevant commands.
- Automatically resize the quickfix list to fit the number of items. Ideally,
  should also work properly when &wrap is set.
