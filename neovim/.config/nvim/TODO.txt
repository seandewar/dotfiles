 vi:set tw=80 fo+=t:

- Use Nvim 0.9's built-in EditorConfig support over vim-sleuth if Nvim detects
  an EditorConfig file for a buffer?
- Use Nvim's exrc support over localvimrc? (Make sure exrc isn't enabled for
  Vim! It does not have vim.secure, and the sandbox is useless)
- Use nvim-dap? GCC also has built-in DAP support now... (but termdebug is
  pretty good)
- Make 'tabline' work better when there's not enough &columns.
- Use neoformat with gq? Maybe also instead remap gq to use LSP's async
  formatting, as the LSP 'formatexpr' blocks and can time out (plus, Lua cannot
  be interrupted yet; if interrupt support is added, maybe consider using LSP's
  'formatexpr' with no timeout?).
- Maybe change 'spell' and neoformat mappings to use <leader>, not sure I like
  using F-keys...
- Maybe change some 'list' stuff (possibly highlights) to look less like text.
  (E.g: I sometimes think trailing spaces are actual "."s, and I don't like
  using Unicode symbols...)
- Yeet netrw (and vim-vinegar)? Netrw's bugs are annoying.
- Make :ConfDir, :DataDir work with a split modifier (maybe use :lcd over :tcd
  in that case).
- Set &cmdheight=0 when low amount of &lines when the feature triggers less
  pointless press-enter prompts. We may also want to temporarily set
  &cmdheight=1 when recording a macro, and unset &showcmd if it still causes
  :file to be truncated.
