TODO:
- gate diagnostic, lsp behind 0.6 and maybe retire some backward-compat parts of
  the config (maybe even plugin_conf.vim too)
- move diagnostics popup logic to diagnostic module; maybe use severity_sort too
- telescope don't overwrite quickfix list (make a new list instead for [C ]C)
- general vim.diagnostic picker for telescope? (probably need to wait for it)
- vim-vsnip completion?

- remove automatic line diagnostics popup (not sure i like it)
- reconsider nvim-dap at some point?
- use v:true for is_current from init.vim?
- split .vim config into separate files?
