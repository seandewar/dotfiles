TODO:
- Use Nvim 0.9's built-in EditorConfig support over vim-sleuth if Nvim detects
  an EditorConfig file for a buffer?
- Use Nvim's exrc support over localvimrc? (Make sure exrc isn't enabled for
  Vim! It does not have vim.secure, and the sandbox is useless)
- Use nvim-dap? GCC also has built-in DAP support now... (but termdebug is
  pretty good)
- Make 'tabline' work better when there's not enough &columns.
- Make 'tabline' show whether a tabpage is viewing &modified buffers.
