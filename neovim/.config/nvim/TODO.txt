 vi:set tw=80 fo+=t:

- Use Nvim 0.9's built-in EditorConfig support over vim-sleuth if Nvim detects
  an EditorConfig file for a buffer?
- Use Nvim's exrc support over localvimrc? (Make sure exrc isn't enabled for
  Vim! It does not have vim.secure, and the sandbox is useless)
- Use nvim-dap? GCC also has built-in DAP support now... (but termdebug is
  pretty good)
- Make 'tabline' work better when there's not enough &columns.
- Make 'tabline' show whether a tabpage is viewing &modified buffers.
- Use neoformat with gq? Maybe also instead remap gq to use LSP's async
  formatting, as the LSP 'formatexpr' blocks and can time out (plus, Lua cannot
  be interrupted yet; if interrupt support is added, maybe consider using LSP's
  'formatexpr' with no timeout?).
- Maybe change 'spell' and neoformat mappings to use <leader>, not sure I like
  using F-keys...
- Maybe change some 'list' stuff (possibly highlights) to look less like text.
  (E.g: I sometimes think trailing spaces are actual "."s, and I don't like
  using Unicode symbols...)
